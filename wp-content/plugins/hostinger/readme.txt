* MySQL 5.6 or greater is recommended

# **Automatic installation**

If you set up a WordPress site on Hostinger's managed WordPress hosting account, this plugin will be automatically installed.

Alternatively, you can use the automatic installation from the dashboard, and WordPress will handle the file transfer - you won't need to leave your web browser. To do an automatic install of the Hostinger plugin, log in to your WordPress dashboard, navigate to the Plugins menu, and click **Add New**.

In the search field, type **Hostinger**, then click **Search Plugins**. Once you find us, you can view details about it, such as the point release, rating, and description. Most importantly, of course, you can install it by clicking **Install Now**, and WordPress will take it from there.

The manual installation method requires downloading the Hostinger plugin and uploading it to your web server via your favorite FTP application. The WordPress codex contains instructions on how to do this here.

# **Updating**

Automatic updates should work smoothly, but we still recommend you back up your site.
