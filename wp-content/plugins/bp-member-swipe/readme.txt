Swipe through your BuddyPress members with a flick of your finger!

== Description ==
Swipe through your BuddyPress members with a flick of your finger on your touch devices, or with a click of your mouse on desktop.

All you need to do is to add the dedicated Gutenberg block "Swipe Directory" to easily create a swipe directory on any of your pages!
The block also includes the following options:
    * Filter members with specific profile fields
    * Choose the order in which the members are displayed

This plugin requires BuddyPress.
